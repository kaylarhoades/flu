# flu for this project we are picking 25 influenza A strains from 2019 and 25 from 2020 and then constructing a phylogenetic tree.

# H5N1 (avian influenza A) is out group
# https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9360372/ info about hemogglutinin and its role in influenza virus transmission
# we are using conda.sh as our sequencing platform
# https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CGOebLC6FZPsCn3Bwy2tyHOOIDTQDSpUzrj0ClJlti4/edit#slide=id.p link to R's GEN725 project to use as a model for our analysis 

# Background: Influenza A is an orthomyxovirus with 8 segments of (-)ssRNA in its genome
# Influenza A contains two major envelope proteins that are surface antigens: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA).
# Hemagglutinin is used for attachment and composes 80% of surface proteins
# HA is responsible for bidning of the virus to cell surface receptors, and it mediatese liberation of the viral genome into the cytoplasm through membrane fusion https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9360372/#:~:text=The%20hemagglutinin(HA)%20of%20influenza,the%20cytoplasm%20through%20membrane%20fusion.
