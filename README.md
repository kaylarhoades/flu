# flu for this project we are picking 25 influenza A strains from 2019 and 25 from 2020 and then constructing a phylogenetic tree.

# Background: Influenza A is an orthomyxovirus with 8 segments of (-)ssRNA in its genome
# Influenza A contains two major envelope proteins that are surface antigens: hemagglutanin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA).
# Hemagglutanin is used for attachment and composes 80% of surface proteins
