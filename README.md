# Relationship Between Influenza A Strains in 2019 vs 2020, with a comparasion to Avian Flu
## Background
### Influenza A is an orthomyxovirus with 8 segments of (-)ssRNA in its genome
### Influenza A contains two major envelope proteins that are surface antigens: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA).
### In this project, we're focused on the hemagglutinin gene, which is used for attachment and composes 80% of surface proteins
### HA is responsible for binding of the virus to cell surface receptors, and it mediates liberation of the viral genome into the cytoplasm through membrane fusion https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9360372/#:~:text=The%20hemagglutinin(HA)%20of%20influenza,the%20cytoplasm%20through%20membrane%20fusion. 

## Methods
### Gathered 12 Influenza A atrains from 2019 and 12 from 2020, then aligned the sequences, ran them on clustalw to create a tree showing the relationship between the strains. Then we repeated this process in order to compare with an outgroup, an avian flu sequence. A second tree was made with the outgroup shown.
##### https://www.genome.jp/tools-bin/clustalw this is the website we used to align our sequences, page shown below

## Findings
### Influenza A phylogenic tree

### Avian strain phylogenic tree

### Alignment of one 2019 vs one 2020 <img width="1314" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-05 at 2 49 51 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103778850/167003747-81ae05ea-7d8a-4316-8216-b94ba0ce75da.png">
## Results
The teal arrow points to the avian flu strain, the outgroup. The branches highlighted in red are associated with the 2019 samples and the ones highlighted in green were collected in 2020. The numbers located in the tree indicate bootstrap values which are a measure of reliability of the split of each branch.

##### Used snap gene to perform a pair wise alignment of a sequence from 2019 and a sequence from 2020. It showed that there weren't many differences besides a few SNPS from 2019 to 2020. There were no major insertions or deletions. The sequences were more similar to each other than we expected. 

### Conclusion
#### We found that all of our Influenza A strains from 2019 and 2020 were all from a common ancestor at some point in time. We also found that the avain flu was not related to the Influenza A strains we found. This could be used in further studies that compares Influenza A strains that arrive in the future.
